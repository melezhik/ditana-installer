# Ditana GNU/Linux

Ditana GNU/Linux is an Arch-based distribution that bridges the gap between user-friendly systems and highly customizable environments. It aims to empower Linux enthusiasts with unprecedented control over their computing experience while maintaining a strong focus on security and performance.

## About Ditana

The name "Ditana" draws inspiration from Ammi-Ditana, a king of ancient Babylon known for his long and peaceful reign. This historical connection reflects our philosophy in several ways:

1. **Stability and Longevity**: We aim to create a Linux distribution that provides long-term stability and support.
2. **Continuous Improvement**: We are committed to building upon the solid foundation of Arch Linux, continuously improving and optimizing the user experience.
3. **Cultural Heritage and Innovation**: Ditana GNU/Linux combines time-tested principles of Linux with modern innovations in security and customization.
4. **Detailed Documentation**: We emphasize comprehensive documentation and transparency in system operations.

## Ditana ISO Builder

This repository contains the Ditana ISO Builder, a core component of the Ditana GNU/Linux project. The Ditana ISO Builder is responsible for creating the installation media for Ditana GNU/Linux, integrating various packages and configurations to produce a cohesive and functional system.

### Key Features of the Ditana ISO Builder:

- **Unified ISO**: One image for both desktop and headless installations.
- **Flexible Installer**: A series of dialogs guides you through the installation process, considering complex dependencies based on your hardware and preferences.
- **Extensive Customization**: From selecting kernel parameters to configuring the desktop environment.
- **XFCE Desktop Environment**: For desktop installations, with pre-installed enhancements.
- **Modular Structure**: Many aspects of Ditana have been separated into individual Arch packages.
- **Hardware Optimization**: Automatic detection and adaptation to your hardware.
- **Enhanced Security**: Pre-configured security features and kernel settings.
- **Performance Tuning**: Intelligent system optimizations for peak performance.

## Repository Structure

This repository (`ditana-installer`) contains the Ditana installer and is based on the `/usr/share/archiso/configs/releng/` directory of the Arch `archiso` package.

- The `archiso` branch maintains the original state of the `archiso` package for easy merging of updates.
- The `build.sh` script in the root directory builds the Ditana ISO.
- Key installer scripts:
  - `airootfs/root/main.raku`: Main entry point for the installer.
  - `airootfs/root/folders/root/chroot-install.sh`: Chroot installation script.
- Ansible playbooks are used for robust and reliable configuration:
  - `airootfs/root/bind-mount/root/enable-arch-multilib-repo.yaml`
  - `airootfs/root/bind-mount/root/configure-grub.yaml`
  - `airootfs/root/bind-mount/root/configure-mkinitcpio.yaml`
  - `airootfs/root/ansible/configure_locale.yaml`

## Ditana Package Management

Ditana follows a modular approach, with many components packaged as separate Arch packages. These packages are available through the official Ditana repository. For a detailed description of each package, please navigate to its GitHub repository.

#### Packaged External Sources

- [kora-yellow-icon-theme](https://github.com/acrion/kora-yellow-icon-theme)

#### Repackaged AUR Contributions

Unlike the packages in previous categories, the following do not have Ditana-specific GitHub repositories. These packages are built directly from the Arch User Repository (AUR) and are provided in the Ditana package repository for seamless installation via pacman:

- [kalu](https://github.com/Thulinma/kalu)
- [python-proxy_tools](https://github.com/jtushman/proxy_tools)
- [python-pywebview](https://github.com/r0x0r/pywebview)
- [stress-ng](https://github.com/ColinIanKing/stress-ng)

##### Chaotic-AUR Integration

Ditana utilizes [Chaotic-AUR](https://github.com/chaotic-aur) to streamline the installation process of AUR packages. This integration significantly reduces build times and computational overhead by providing pre-built packages from the AUR. By default, Chaotic-AUR support is enabled in Ditana, but users have the option to disable it during the installation process.

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the maintainers of Chaotic-AUR for their invaluable contribution to the Arch Linux community. Their work greatly enhances the user experience by making AUR packages more accessible and easier to manage.

It’s worth noting that the packages listed in this "Repackaged AUR Contributions" section are not available in Chaotic-AUR. These AUR packages are repackaged for the Ditana repository because they are either dependencies for other Ditana-specific packages listed in the previous categories, or for the Ditana installer. By including these repackaged AUR contributions, we ensure a smooth and integrated experience for Ditana users, maintaining consistency across the entire system.

### Ditana Repository

Main server: https://ditana.org/ditana

The Ditana repository is powered by Cloudflare, which provides caching and content delivery network (CDN) services. This setup offers several advantages:

- Improved global accessibility and reduced latency
- Enhanced reliability and uptime
- Protection against DDoS attacks
- Automatic SSL/TLS encryption

### Using Ditana Packages Outside of Ditana

To use Ditana packages in a non-Ditana Arch-based system, follow these steps:

1. Add the following to the end of your `/etc/pacman.conf`:

   ```
   [ditana]
   Include = /etc/pacman.d/ditana-mirrorlist
   ```

2. Create a file named `/etc/pacman.d/ditana-mirrorlist` with the following content:

   ```
   Server = https://ditana.org/$repo/$arch
   ```

3. Update your package database:

   ```
   sudo pacman -Sy
   ```

You can now install Ditana packages using `pacman`.
